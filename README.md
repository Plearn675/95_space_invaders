My goal is not to spend a lot of time on UX, but rather to create a script with the following features:

1. Turtle window (game area)

2. Bottom-line info bar (for my lives and score)

3. My own spaceship

4. The ability to move left and right

5. The ability to shoot (missile moving)

6. Enemy ships (not moving at first, maybe in a more advanced phase, they will move left and right in formation)

7. Detection of collision between my missile and the enemy spacecraft

8. (Other improvements needed after these previous features are completed)
